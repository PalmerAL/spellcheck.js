<h1>Spellcheck.js: a lightweight, pattern based spellchecker</h1>
<h2>What's different?</h2>
<p>While most spellcheckers use a large dictionary of every word in English, spellcheck.js uses a small list of common words that it extends by making predictions based on common English spelling rules. This makes it much smaller than other spellcheckers (under 3k minified and gzipped).</p>
	
	
<h2>How to use</h2>
	
	<p>notes: <br>
	
	 - this only works correctly with single-word inputs - don't try to input multiple words. <br>
	 - the getSuggestions() and getBestReplacement() assume the word is misspelled, so run checkSpelling() first.</p>

<h3>checkSpelling(word)</h3>
	
	<p>Check to see if a word is spelled correctly. Returns true or false</p>
	
<h3>getBestReplacement(word)</h3>
	
	<p>Get the best possible replacement for a misspelled word.  Returns an object with <code>{value, diff}</code>, where value is the best possible replacement and diff is a number (can be infinite, but 0 is an exact match and 1 or higher is completely different).</p>
	
<h3>getSuggestions(word)</h3>
	
	<p>Returns an array of possible suggestions for the given word</p>
